# F2BA (Fully First-Order Bilevel Approximation)

Official repository for "Near-Optimal Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with Fully First-Order Oracles" and a series of follow-up works.

## News

* (2025/9) We improve F2BA in the stochastic setting to achieve near-optimal rates for highly smooth problems and post our result on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02937).

* (2025/7) Use [ScaleBiO](https://github.com/2003pro/ScaleBiO) as codebase. See the LLM folder.

* (2025/5) F2BA is accepted by JMLR 2025.

* (2024/5) Our work on hardness results [2] is accepted by COLT 2024, and we also extend F2BA to structured nonconvex-nonconvex (NC-NC) problems.

* (2023/6) We prove F2BA [1] is near-optimal for nonconvex-strongly-convex (NC-SC) problems and post our result on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14853).
