Official repository for "Near-Optimal Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with Fully First-Order Oracles".

We prove the penalty method with a two-time-scale update achieves near-optimal first-order complexity. 

The penalty method is widely used in practice and has achieved impressive performance. We do not provide the codes, but just recommend the following two implementations:

* [BOME](https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/BOME)
* [ScaleBiO](https://github.com/2003pro/ScaleBiO)
