# F2BA (Fully First-Order Bilevel Approximation)

Official repository for "Near-Optimal Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with Fully First-Order Oracles".

We prove the penalty method with a two-time-scale update achieves near-optimal first-order complexity. 

 For large-scaled experiments on LLM data-cleaning, please refer to the [LLM](https://github.com/TrueNobility303/F2BA/tree/main/LLM) folder. 
For medium-scaled experiments on "learn-to-regularize", please refer to the [Hpo](https://github.com/TrueNobility303/F2BA/tree/main/Hpo) folder.
