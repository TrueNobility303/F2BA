# F2BA (Fully First-Order Bilevel Approximation)

Official repository for "Near-Optimal Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with Fully First-Order Oracles".

We prove the widely-used penalty method with a two-time-scale update achieves near-optimal first-order complexity. 

For large-scaled experiments on LLM data-cleaning, please refer to the [LLM](https://github.com/TrueNobility303/F2BA/tree/main/LLM) folder.
