# F2BA (Fully First-Order Bilevel Approximation)

Official repository for "Near-Optimal Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with Fully First-Order Oracles".

## Breaking News

* (2025/9) We post F2SA-p on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02937).

* (2025/7) Change the codebase with [ScaleBiO](https://github.com/2003pro/ScaleBiO). See the [LLM](https://github.com/TrueNobility303/F2BA/tree/main/LLM) folder.

* (2025/5) F2BA [2] is accepted by JMLR.

* (2024/5) Our work on hardness results [1] is accepted by COLT 2024.
